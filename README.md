# Pokémon Sorting List

What you can do with this:

* Drag Pokémon from the list on the left (Somebody's PC) to the list on the right (your team).
* Sort the Pokémon on your team however you please!
* Check out the tooltips for each Pokémon to see what species it is.
* You can't take multiple of the same Pokémon from the PC, but don't worry, the PC will only let you put each Pokémon in your team once.
* Click the red button to remove a Pokémon from your team, and put them back in the PC.
* When you're happy with your team, just hit the save button in the top right to keep them in place.
